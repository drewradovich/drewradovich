I'm a data analyst with a passion for transforming raw data into actionable insights. With proficiency in R, SQL, Power BI, Tableau, and Excel, I specialize in retail logistics and data analysis, helping businesses optimize operations and drive data-driven decision-making. I'm passionate about asking "why" and uncovering trends in data that help stakeholders understand what really contributes to their success.

Currently, I'm pursuing my MS in Program Evaluation and Data Analytics at ASU, further honing my skills in statistical analysis, data visualization, and evaluation methodologies.

ðŸ“Š What I do:

- Extract, clean, and analyze complex datasets
- Build interactive dashboards and reports to support business decisions
- Apply statistical models and evaluation frameworks for deeper insights

ðŸ’¬ Who I Am:

- I am an avid football fan including the Premier League, Champion's League, and MLS
- I'm addicted to pastries and coffee and love to explore local shops
- I yearn to be a lifelong learner and am always seeking opportunities to expand my skillset and learn new things

ðŸš€ I'm always eager to collaborate on data-driven projects and learn new techniques to enhance my analytical toolkit. Feel free to explore my repositories and connect!
